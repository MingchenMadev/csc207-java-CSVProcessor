>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>CSVProcessor<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
----->Summary
	Generally, I believe that this CSVProcessor can function well, but 
	its documentaion needs impovement. The first half is carefully wirtten
	while the second half is not that good. The second half needs to be
	clearier.The design of this class is nice. But some of the functions should
	be put in a separate class.
	All the helper functions and instance variables are private.
	All the function names are easily understood and I like the variable names
	they uses. 

----->Documentation
line 31 the Javadoc comment should start with /** 
line 35 the Javadoc comment should start with /**
line 85 the Javadoc comment does not mention that the function get
	UserInput() throws an IOException exception
line 96 this line is neither a comment nor a code, it should be 
	deleted
line 101 the Javadoc comment does not mention that this function 
	throws an InputException exception
line 106 the function's @return statement is missing
line 151 the function's Javadoc does mention that a line is 
	printed when the raw_input is a define command
line 207 the function's Javadoc is not specific enough for users.
	Need more information on the return value.
line 235 the Javadoc comment on @param scopeVariable is missing.
line 246 the format of param columnDefinitions is not given.
 	it needs to be more specific.
line 265 the function splitColumnDefinition() also converts all
	column headers to lowercase. But this is not metioned in the
	Javadoc.
line 271 the Javadoc of main() is not specific enough. Many important
	things are not mentioned.(such as what main() does)
line 359 the @return statement of function loadHander is missing.
line 380 the @return statement of function columnsHandler is missing.
line 402 the Javadoc for function rowsHandler is not clear for users.
line 407 the @return statement of function rowsHandler is missing.
line 428 the @return statement of function productHandler is missing.
line 457 the @return statement of function joinHanderler is missing.
line 484 the Javadoc of naturalJoinHandler is not clear for users.
line 489 the @return statement of function naturalJoinHandler is missing.
line 497 the Javadoc of orderbyHandler is not clear for users.
line 502 the @return statement of function orderbyHandler is missing.


----->Design
line 39 the function compareValue is too long
line 39 the function compareValue is not supposed to be in this
	class from design perspective
line 100 the fuction identifyCommandType() is too long
line 520 it will be better if the exception is written in the
 	separate class.

----->Summary
	This class is well-written and well-considered. All the helper functions
	are private. The Javadoc is pretty clear and all the comments are helpful.
	All the function names are easily understood and I like the variable names
	they uses. The design are well-organised and well-considered. To be 
	honest, it is hard to find mistakes in this class.

----->Documentation
line 10 The Javadoc is not clear. What does it mean by "Take a column and
	a column index"? Should it be "Take a table and a column index."?

----->Summary
	This class is well-written and well-considered. All the helper functions and
	instance variables are private.
	All the function names are easily understood and I like the variable names
	they uses. The design are well-organised and well-considered.
	But some of the Javadocs are not clear. It needs more documentation to clearify
	the content of table. There is also something they can improve on design.
	
----->Documentation
line 26 A clearfy on the rows and columns is needed.(ie, is this 2D
	array array of columns or array of rows.)
line 41 A clearfy on the rows and columns is needed.(ie, is this 2D
	array array of columns or array of rows.)
line 54 The Javadoc is not clear since it does not clearify the
	matching relation.(ie, is x for rows or y for rows)
line 112 It is better to use the word "returns" than "gets" in the
	Javadoc. 

----->Design
line 128 It will be better if function equalTo() is in another class.
