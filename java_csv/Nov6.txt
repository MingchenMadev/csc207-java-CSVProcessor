We did:
Part of the coding of FileReader class.
We write the function to handle all kinds of expressions in CSVProcessor class, including Column_evaluate, Rows_evaluate, Join_evaluate, Product_evaluate, 
Natural_join_evaluate, Orderby_evaluate. These function will call the corresponding function under the Table class and pass the instance variables to
those functions.
Also, we write the variable assignment function, which is used to store name string, table object pairs in a Hashmap called Assignment. This function will be called after the evaluation of expressions.

We will:
Before the next day,
set up the team meeting on Nov 7th and 
do the works that is assigned to all the team members. 
We would try to finish the core parts of table class and make some test_cases.

Things that is impeding our progress:
We schedule and assign the work so that everyone can work on it at home.
Our schdules differ a lot so that we are not able to work and discuss
everything together.
