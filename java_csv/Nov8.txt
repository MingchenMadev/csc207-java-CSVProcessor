*Insert
*size
*CombineRow
*getitem
We modify the constructor of the table class.
*valueCompare

We combined Row class, Column class, Table class and FileReader together
and we made them work properly.
We used row presentation to present the table now.
We modified the docstrings and comments for Table class.

We will:
Before the next day,
set up the team meeting on Nov 9th and 
We assign works to team members for them to work on at home.
We would try to finish some test cases for our modified classes.

Things that is impeding our progress:
Everyone has different ideas of re-modifing our code, it is very hard to get Everyone's thought together.
