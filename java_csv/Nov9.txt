We did:
We finished CSVExpression class
	made the functions for most of the expressions in the product backlog.
	created test cases for all of them
We finished CSVCommand class
	made the functions for the commands in the product backlog and created 	test cases for all of them.
We modify the constructor of the table class.
and we gather all our classes together.
We used row presentation to present the table now.
We modified the docstrings and comments for Table class.

We will:
Before the next day,
set up the team meeting on Nov 10th and 
We assign works to team members for them to work on at home.
We would try to finish some test cases for our modified classes.

Things that is impeding our progress:
Everyone has different ideas of re-modifing our code, it is very hard to get Everyone's thought together.
