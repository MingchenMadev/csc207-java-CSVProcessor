We did:
Viewed and consider about comments from the TA.
Assigned tasks to individual team member and finish the ProductBacklog.
Fixed the flaws in our design and make the code more efficient avoid redundancy.
Part of the coding of FileHandling Class and made some test cases for the commands.

We will:
Before the next day,
set up the team meeting on Nov 6th and 
do the works that is assigned to all the team members. 
We will try to finish every part of the Commands and combine them together.

Things that is impeding our progress:
There are group members missing due to communication errors and busy schedules.
It takes a lot of work to get everyone's thoughts together and better our design.
We schedule and assign the work so that everyone can work on it at home.
And after a long discussion,we bring our thoughts together and complete the final design of our codes.
